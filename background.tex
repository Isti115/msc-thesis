\chapter{Background}
\label{chp:background}

In the following chapter we introduce the material that we based our formalization on and the system we chose as our meta-theory. We do not cover the whole model in detail, but mostly focus on the concepts that are needed for understanding the results of our work. A short introduction to Agda, the language of our choice can also be found at the end of the chapter.
