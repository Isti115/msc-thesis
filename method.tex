\chapter{Method}

Our approach started with an implementation of a highly simplified model in Idris, that served as an initial proof-of-concept. The development process was done in an iterative style, meaning that we had to backtrack multiple times and rewrite certain parts over and over, but this often helped in finding better solutions. Some simple proofs were written in Idris, but after trying to expand to a more complex model, the type checking of Idris seemed to be too slow, which led to the decision of switching to Agda.
