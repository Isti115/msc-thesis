abstract="Hoare's logical system for specifying and proving partial correctness properties of sequential programs is generalized to concurrent programs. The basic idea is to define the assertion {\{}P{\}} S {\{}Q{\}} to mean that if execution is begun anywhere in S with P true, then P will remain true until S terminates, and Q will be true if and when S terminates. The predicates P and Q may depend upon program control locations as well as upon the values of variables. A system of inference rules and axiom schemas is given, and a formal correctness proof for a simple program is outlined. We show that by specifying certain requirements for the unimplemented parts, correctness properties can be proved without completely implementing the program. The relation to Pnueli's temporal logic formalism is also discussed.",

abstract="How can we rigorously prove that an algorithm does what we think it does? Logically verifying programs is very important to industry. Floyd-Hoare Logic (or Hoare Logic for short) is a set of rules that describe a type of valid reasoning for sequential program veriﬁcation. Many diﬀerent attempts have been made to extend Hoare Logic for concurrent program veriﬁcation. We combine ideas from a few of these extensions to formalise a veriﬁcation framework for speciﬁc classes of parallel programs. A new proof rule to deal with the semantics of mesh algorithms is proposed within the veriﬁcation framework. We use the framework and mesh proof rule to verify the correctness of Sung Bae’s parallel algorithm for the maximum subarray problem.",

abstract = "Thanks to recent advances, modern proof assistants now enable verification of realistic sequential programs. However, regarding the concurrency paradigm, previous work essentially focused on formalization of abstract systems, such as pure concurrent calculi, which are too minimal to be realistic. In this paper, we propose a library that enables verification of realistic concurrent programs in the Coq proof assistant. Our approach is based on an extension of the π-calculus whose encoding enables such programs to be modeled conveniently. This encoding is coupled with a specification language akin to spatial logics, including in particular a notion of fairness, which is important to write satisfactory specifications for realistic concurrent programs. In order to facilitate formal proof, we propose a collection of lemmas that can be reused in the context of different verifications. Among these lemmas, the most effective for simplifying the proof task take advantage of confluence properties. In order to evaluate feasibility of verification of concurrent programs using this library, we perform verification for a non-trivial application."

The correctness of a mail server is very important: bugs of the mail server may be abused for eavesdropping mail contents, spreading virus, sending spam messages, etc. We have verified a part of a mail server written in Java, by manually translating the Java program into a Coq function as faithfully as possible, and verifying properties of the Coq function. The results of this experiment indicate the feasibility and usefulness of verification of middle-sized system softwares in this style. The verification has been carried out in a few months, and a few bugs in the mail server have been indeed found during the verification process.",
