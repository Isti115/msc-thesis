In \cite{proving-parallel-assertions} several properties of an elementary airline reservation system implemented in a general parallel programming language are verified.

A case study \cite{coq-concurrent-verification-case-study} shows that there are many advantages to the library based approach, which eliminates some complicated modeling tasks by implementing a generalized version of parallelism. They investigate these properties through the verification procedure of a mail server originally written in Java by rewriting it in Coq. \cite{coq-mail-server}
The development of the library is discussed in \cite{AFFELDT200817}.
